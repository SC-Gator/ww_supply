# Wall wart Â±12V power supply

## Untested! Assume nothing has been checked and nothing works!

This is a power supply based on the [MFOS wall wart supply](http://musicfromouterspace.com/analogsynth_new/WALLWARTSUPPLY/WALLWARTSUPPLY.php). Differences are:

* Added polyfuses
* Added LEDs
* Input is a pluggable terminal block, with another one for daisy chaining
* Output is a (non pluggable) terminal block
* Regulators are vertical, with space for Tayda A-5093 heat sinks
* Board is shorter and wider (100 x 61 mm) to keep fabbing price low
