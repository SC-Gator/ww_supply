# Wall wart ±12V power supply

## Untested! Assume nothing has been checked and nothing works!

### Note: In earlier version barrel jack was CONNECTED INCORRECTLY. This has now been fixed — I think. But don't assume it's right!

This is a power supply based on the [MFOS wall wart supply](http://musicfromouterspace.com/analogsynth_new/WALLWARTSUPPLY/WALLWARTSUPPLY.php). Differences are:

* Added polyfuses
* Added LEDs
* Input is either barrel jack or pluggable terminal block, with another pluggable terminal block for daisy chaining
* Output is a (non pluggable) terminal block
* Regulators are vertical, with space for Tayda A-5093 heat sinks
* Board is shorter and wider (100 x 61 mm) to keep fabbing price low
